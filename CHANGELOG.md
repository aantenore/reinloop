# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Structured output reaches the model also when the agent has tools: Anthropic gets `output_config.format`
  (merged with any `output_config` from `params.extra`, objects closed with `additionalProperties: false`), and
  OpenAI-compatible providers keep `response_format`. Local presets (`ollama`, `lmstudio`, `vllm`) use the new
  `structuredOutput: "without-tools"` mode.
- Built-in prices for `claude-opus-5-5`, `claude-sonnet-5-5` and `claude-haiku-5-5`, and a top-level `pricing`
  config section with per-model overrides merged over the built-in table.
